 Use the following transition words in these particular locations in your essay:
1. In the second paragraph, start the paragraph with the word “First.”
2. In the third paragraph, start the paragraph with the word “Second.”
3. In the fourth paragraph, start the paragraph with the word “Finally.”
4. In the fifth paragraph, begin the paragraph with the words “Inconclusion.”

The first paragraph is an introductory paragraph. It should have a hook that will grab the reader’s attention in the first sentence. The last sentence should be your thesis statement. Make sure your thesis statement is only one sentence in length. Your second paragraph should discuss in more detail the first solution you mentioned in your thesis statement. Your third paragraph should discuss in greater detail the second solution you mentioned in your thesis statement to reduce the number of people who contract the coronavirus. Your fourth paragraph should discuss the third solution you mentioned in your thesis statement. You fifth paragraph is your conclusion. It should also have your thesis statement in it, either as an exact restatement or as a paraphrase of the thesis statement you had in your introduction. Every paragraph must have at least five different sentences in it  pythonprac@python.com
